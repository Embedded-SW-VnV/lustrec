* TODO
** include files
** main function
*** add a clean test to forbid array arguments for main node
    (no available input/output methods)
** test suite
*** for complex dependency graphs (notably mem/mem cyclic dependencies)
*** for clocks
*** for arrays (non-generic nodes)
** compare with lus2c (verimag)
** extension
*** array access: done
*** add an option to dynamically check array accesses: done
*** power operator: done
*** automaton
*** annotations to ACSL
** init checking
*** to be done !!!
** normalization
*** sub-expression sharing seems to be not totally working: fixed
*** improve behavior for power and access operators:done
*** more type-directed normalization (notably to improve code gen for arrays): done
*** reuse of dead vars instead of systematically allocating new local vars
*** add a clean test for used but undefined nodes
** typing
*** correct typing of arith ops (real/int with subtyping ?)
*** display array dimensions with correct names: done
*** clocks must not be static inputs: done
** clock calculus
*** extension from named clocks to valued clocks ?
*** static inputs should be polymorphic, as global constants are: done
