* Cocospec integration
** Objective
Enable the parsing of cocospec in comments. The syntax is the one of Kind2 but
could be extended later.

In terms of integration within LustreC, it has to be done at all stages
- parsing/lexing
- typing
- clocking
- normalization: the cocospec lustre equations have to be normalized 
- printing
- machine code
- various backends
  - EMF
  - LustreV/Zustre
  - C code

** Open questions

The cocospec syntax is appealing for multiple aspects wrt the our previous
annotation language.
- more structure
- notion of contracts that can be imported, reused
- more expressivity: local variables within contracts (more like regular lustre
  definitions *)

But also some not-so-nice features (ploc's remarks):
- annotations next to the node header shall be before rather than after. We also
  don't want pure specification artifact as top level definition in the lustre
  file (no contract def outside comments)
  - Frama-C inspiration
    I would prefer like in framac:  
    //@ensures prop; 
    node foo (...) returns (...);

    Rather than
    node foo (...) returns (...);
    //@ensures prop; 
  
    While it make sense when you provide specification within the lustre file, it
    is less appropriate when specifying outside the lustre model. Eg in a lusi, #open
    spec.lusi

  - Kind2 approach
    In Kind2 they have a notion of interfaces, but they need an explicit local
    annotation linking the node to the contract

    In foo.lus we would have 
    #include foo_spec.lus

    node bar (...) returns (...);
    (*@ contract import bar_spec (in) returns (out); *)
    let  ... tel 
  
    In foo_spec.lus 
    contract bar_spec (..) returns (..)

  - Remote specification (in lusi)
    We would like to enable both local spec and remote ones (in a separate file).
    A solution could be to extend the lusi syntax, for example something like
    node bar (...) returns (...)
    let
      @ensures ...
      @requires ...
    tel

    Or, more generally, support contracts definition only in lusi and assigning
    contracts to nodes in the lusi or in the lus
 
    For example in the lusi

    contract bar_spec1 () returns ();
    let 
     ... contract 1
    tel

    contract bar_spec2 () returns ();
    let 
     ... contract 2
    tel

    node bar (...) returns (...);
    (*@ contract 
          import bar_spec1 (in) returns (out);
          import bar_spec2 (in) returns (out);
    *)
  
    node bar2 (...) returns (...);
    (*@ contract guarantee expr; *)
  
    Or with annotations before the headers
    (*@ contract 
          import bar_spec1 (in) returns (out);
          import bar_spec2 (in) returns (out);
    *)
    node bar (...) returns (...);
  
    (*@ contract guarantee expr; *)
    node bar2 (...) returns (...);

    In the associated lustre file
    
    #open my_spec.lusi
    
    node bar (...) returns (...)
    let
      full definition
    tel
   
    node bar3 (...) returns (...)
    (*@ contract my_remote contract *)
    let
      full definition
    tel

    -- a local contract
    node bar4 (...) returns (...)
    (*@ contract guarantee expr; *)
    let
      full definition
    tel

    But no contracts definition within the lustre ourside of special comments

** Current status
- Existing works in lustrec
  ensures/requires/observer in the syntax, which were parsed, typed, normalized

- Choice of placement of annotations
  - no contract in lustre only in lusi
  - in lustre file: contract attached to lustre node before the locals/let
  - in lusi file: contract attached to lustre node before the node foo ...

** Development
*** Done
- (ploc) retirer le parser Kind2 et revenir à celui de lustrec
*** To be done
**** Court terme
- (CG) etendre la syntaxe pour coller à la definition donnée ci-dessus
  - lexeur/parseur lustreSpec + document latex de grammaire
- repartir la branche acsl2018 qui contient la normalisation des eexpr
  - le refaire compiler
  - merger avec unstable 
- transformer cette normalisation pour partager les definitions locales de
  variables dans le noeud de spec, aka contract

**** Apres
- developper dans les backends
  - C
  - EMF
  - LustreV

* TODO refactoring + doc
- DONE separate lustre types from machine types in different files
- DONE split basic libs into backend specific files
- DONE define mli for core steps: normalization and machine code
- define mli for lustre_type and machine_type (Garion)

* Horn backend
** enum types for automaton
   - issues with MBranches and clocks
     - control-on-clock generates a "if cond then expr else nothing
     - it has to be expressed in a functional way to enable its expression as
       horn


-  The issue seems mainly to lie in the out = f(in) every cond
   this generates the follwoingg imperative statements
   if cond then f_reset(*mem) else {(nothing, ie. not reset)}
   f_step(in,*put,*mem)

   In the machine code, this is done by generating the sequence of 2 instructions
   1. if cond then MReset() else {}  (* creation of a conditional statement *)
   2. MStep()

- For Xavier: Syntactically, how could you "reset" an arrow? When we see an
  Expr_arrow, we introduce a MReset instance to the set of instruction on the
  reset function of the current node, but is there any mean to do it with
  "every" ?




x = expr when c

if c then
  x= expr

else {}

x = if c then expr else x
* Seal

The Seal library should be available from LustreV

lustrev -seal -node foo bar.lus 

shall inline completely the node foo in bar.lus and compile it as a
piecewise system: 
- Memories have to be identified and one needs to separate the update
  of the memories and the production of the output.
- The update block should be normalized so that any ite occuring in
  the definition of a memory should not define a local flow used in
  basic operations.  In other words, the definitions should look like
  mem_x = if g then e1 else e2 where e1 and e2 are either ite
  expression or expressions without ite. As soon as a not-ite
  expression is selected it cannot depend on the output of an ite.

In a first step this normalized update shall be printed in
stdout. Later it will associated to a SEAL datastructure through SEAL
API.

** Algorithm

*** 1. Computation of update block
- First we inline the node
- After normalization the memories are the variables defined by a pre
- Do we have to deal with arrows and reset?
- Develop a function to perform slicing. Restrict the node eqs to the ones used in these pre defs.
- one can also slice the expressions on the output variables

*** 2. Normalization: piecewise system
 ie. all ite pushed at the beginning

- use the scheduling to obtain the dependencies amongs eqs
- one can then iterate through eqs from the bottom to the top
  if the eq looks like x = if g then e1 else e2
  then tag x as ite(g,e1,e2)
  if the parent expr y = if g2 then x else ... make 
** More general use
Some ideas
- One could request multiple nodes: how to deal with these? Acting as
  as many calls to the basic procedure?
- Shall we keep the flatten update structure to the node? Another
  property on input could be propagated.
- The analysis will depend on bounds on input flows. Can we specialize
  the update blocks based on input values, ie. disabling some branches
  of the ite-tree?
-
